This is a interior designing wesite that i recently made. It's my first project. In my project I have
used HTML(to give a basic structure) and CSS(for styling the page) It is one of the initial project that I have built to get a common-understanding how to style your html
using CSS. while doing this project I came to know many CSS propertise as well gained info about this industry.
